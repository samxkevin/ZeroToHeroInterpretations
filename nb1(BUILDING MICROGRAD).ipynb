    "When you call `c.backward()`, Micrograd computes the gradients of `c` with respect to `a` and `b` by traversing the expression graph backwards. It applies the chain rule to determine how changes in `a` and `b` influence `c`. This is known as Backpropagation. Backpropagation is an algorithm used in neural networks to compute gradients. It works by propagating the error backward through the network, applying the chain rule to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight. This enables the network to update weights and minimize the error, improving its performance during training."

    "* A small change in `a` causes a change in `c` three times as large.\n",
    "* A small change in `b` causes a change in `c` four times as large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression graph tracks all dependencies, and backpropagation efficiently calculates these gradients. This process is fundamental in neural networks, allowing for weight updates during training to minimize loss. Backpropagation applies to many operations, including in Multi-Layered Perceptrons (MLPs), where inputs and weights interact through matrix operations. Starting from `c`, the gradient is computed by applying the chain rule recursively to all nodes in the expression graph influencing `c`."

In the case of creating a new `Value` object using algebraic expression, we first write the expression lasting with the semicolon and then assign the `label` to the resulting `Value` object using `object.label = 'label_name'`. _Since_, Algebraic expressions like `a*b+c` create unlabeled intermediate `Value` objects during evaluation. Only after the full expression is assigned to `d` can `d.label` be set."
